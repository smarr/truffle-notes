Add Graal JIT Compilation to Your JVM Language in 5 Easy Steps
==============================================================

## What Is Graal JIT Compilation and How Can It Be Useful?

[Graal][2] is a just-in-time compiler for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM),
written in Java. In combination with the [Truffle][1] framework, one can
implement simple [abstract-syntax-tree (AST) interpreters][3] that can
automatically use the Graal compiler. This means, one only has to implement the
language once as an interpreter, and essentially gets a JIT compiler for free
that can reach the performance of state-of-the-art virtual machines such as
HotSpot for Java or V8 for JavaScript. Thus, Graal is a useful to reach good
performance without building a custom virtual machine.

An alternative approach would be [RPython][4] with its meta-tracing
just-in-time compiler. A more thorough comparison of the two approaches can be
found [here][5] and [here][6]. However, for this series of blog posts, we are
interested in a language running on top of the JVM, and thus, Truffle is our
framework of choice.

# Step 1: Setting A Goal and Choose A Benchmark

Truffle provides a nice set of features to simplify the implementation of
languages. However, we want to focus here on using Graal and Truffle to improve
the performance of a language implementation. So, let's look into the following
example from this perspective.

## The Numerical Performance of Golo

Our language of choice is going to be [Golo][7]. Golo has been designed as a
dynamic language for the JVM that benefits from the JVM's `invokedynamic`
mechanism to provide an expressive yet simple language experience. If you
haven't heard of it before, don't worry. We will stick to the basics and focus
on features that are common to many languages. From some basic benchmarks, we
know that [Golo is still quite a bit slower on numeric code than Java][8].

## Mandelbrot as a Benchmark

To keep it simple, but still chose something that can be used to investigate
performance, we use a Mandelbrot calculation as our main example. The
following code snippet is an abbreviated version of the [Java benchmark][9] we
will use:

```java
while (y < size) {
  double ci = (2.0 * y / size) - 1.0;
  int x = 0;

  while (x < size) {
    // ...
    double cr = (2.0 * x / size) - 1.5;

    int z = 0;
    int escape = 1;

    while (z < 50) {
      zr = zrzr - zizi + cr;
      zi = 2.0 * zr * zi + ci;

      zrzr = zr*zr;
      zizi = zi*zi;

      if (zrzr + zizi > 4.0) {
        escape = 0;
        break;
      }
// remainder left out for brevity
```

In this fragment, we got three nested loops that work mostly on `double`
values. For a dynamic language, this means that it is essential for reaching
good performance to optimize the lookup of operators and methods as well as the
way `double` values are treated.

In dynamic languages, the concrete operation behind the multiplication '`*`' the
division '`/`' or a less-than '`<`' comparison operator is typically known only at
runtime. For optimal performance a language implementation needs to ensure that
that these operators are not looked up for every single operation, even if the
general program semantics do not give any guarantees about the values they
might operate on. Furthermore, sophisticated optimizations need to be able to
move the processor instructions related to such lookups out of loops. Otherwise,
the simple comparison in a loop condition could incur a huge overhead.

Similarly, `double` values are often treated as objects. This usually means
that they have a boxed representation. Thus, an object is allocated to hold the
underlying primitive value of the `double`. This however means, that an object
needs to be allocated. Since each operation potentially produces a new `double`
object, this could mean a lot of work for the garbage collector. Another
drawback is that the actual `double` value has to be unboxed before it can be
processed by processor instructions. This means that there is at least a
dereference operation for the value before the actual computation happens.

In future parts of this series of blog posts, we will see how these issues can
be approached with Graal and Truffle.

## Initial Performance Comparison

To get an initial idea of the performance difference between Golo and Java on
our Mandelbrot benchmark, we are going to measure the peak performance. For
that, we execute the benchmark on each VM 100 times and measure the execution
time for the last 10 iterations.

```{r initial-performance, fig.height=3, fig.width=7, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
## Avoid the usual ReBench setup
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)
times_java_ns <- c(108918, 109289, 108809, 114980, 104198, 107264, 108012, 109215, 104651, 107225, 105856)
times_golo_ns <- c(526187, 506568, 519333, 515142, 511595, 512679, 522535, 488186, 511581, 502145, 515739)
data <- data.frame(VM = c(rep("Java", 11), rep("Golo", 11)), Time.ns = c(times_java_ns, times_golo_ns), stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
stats <- ddply(data, ~ VM, summarise, Time.ms = mean(Time.ns) / 1000, sd = sd(Time.ns) / 1000)
col <- c("#729fcf", "#e9b96e")
ggplot(stats, aes(x = VM, y = Time.ms, fill = VM)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymax = Time.ms + sd, ymin = Time.ms - sd), width=0.25) +
  coord_flip() + theme_bw() + scale_fill_manual(values=col) +
  theme(legend.position="none")
  
  
g <- stats[stats$VM == "Golo",]$Time.ms
j <- stats[stats$VM == "Java",]$Time.ms
slowdown <- round(g / j, 1)
```

As result, we see that Mandelbrot takes about `r round(j)`ms to execute on
Java and about `r round(g)`ms on Golo, which means, Golo is about `r slowdown`x
slower for our Mandelbrot benchmark, leaving plenty of room to
increase Golo's performance.

## Next Time: A First Look at Golo

Before we start adding Graal support, the next part of this blog post series
looks briefly into the current Golo implementation. It compiles Golo directly
to JVM bytecodes and relies heavily on `invokedynamic` to realize the dynamic
language semantics. Interestingly, Golo does not have bit operations. We'll use
that as an excuse to we will get a basic idea of how the implementation works
and then can compare it later to the Graal+Truffle version.
