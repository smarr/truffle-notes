Truffle-lize Your Language Implementation in 5 Easy Steps
=========================================================

# Step 4: Complete Support for Mandelbrot

In the the [previous post][TODO] of the series, we built up all the
infrastructure to execute a simple Fibonacci function with a Truffle backend
for Golo. This included an introduction to the basic aspects of Truffle, its
support for specializations, the idiomatic ways for realizing sequences,
control flow, basic operators, and literals. Together with the discussion of
how function invocation can be implemented, we covered most aspects that
are required also for our final goal, i.e., to support the execution of the
Mandelbrot program from the very [first post][TODO] in the series.

Below, the main part of the Mandelbrot program implemented in Java:

```java
while (y < size) {
  double ci = (2.0 * y / size) - 1.0;
  int x = 0;

  while (x < size) {
    // ...
    double cr = (2.0 * x / size) - 1.5;

    int z = 0;
    int escape = 1;

    while (z < 50) {
      zr = zrzr - zizi + cr;
      zi = 2.0 * zr * zi + ci;

      zrzr = zr*zr;
      zizi = zi*zi;

      if (zrzr + zizi > 4.0) {
        escape = 0;
        break;
      }
// remainder left out for brevity
```

Since much of what we needed to support Mandelbrot are extensions, or based on
the same principles that we discussed before, this post will be much shorter
and only sketch the changes to existing elements. However, we discuss in
greater detail how to add local variables, loops, and how to call Java
functions based on method handles.

## Extensions for Longs, Doubles, Strings, and Basic Operations

In a first step, we extend the `Types` class and the `ExpressionNode` to support
long and double primitives as well as Strings for specialization. The `Types`
class looks now like this:

```java
@TypeSystem({
  int.class,
  boolean.class,
  long.class,    // added for Mandelbrot
  double.class,  // added for Mandelbrot
  String.class,  // added for Mandelbrot
  Object[].class
})
class Types { }
```

In the `ExpressionNode`, we merely add the missing `executeLong(.)`,
`executeDouble(.)`, and `executeString(.)` methods in the same way as the
existing ones. This will then allow a node to speculate on the child nodes
always evaluating to for instance a primitive `long` value.

As we can see in the Mandelbrot program above, we also need support for
literals. Specifically, we are going to add nodes for literal `long`, `double`,
and `string` values. Furthermore, we add nodes for the `true`, `false`, and
`null` literals. With the `IntegerLiteralNode` from the last post, we already
saw the general idea. For `true`, `false`, and `null` it is even simpler, we
merely return the fixed value on execution. So, it looks like this:

```java
class NullLiteralNode extends LiteralNode {

  public Object executeGeneric(VirtualFrame frame) {
    return null;
  }
}
```

Since Mandelbrot is mostly about computation, we also need a range of additions
and extensions to support multiplication, division, additions, subtraction,
less-than, equal as well as not-equal. Furthermore, we need to implement the
Truffle versions of the `xor`, `or`, and `left shift` bit operators.

Below find a sketch of the addition as implemented by the `PlusNode`. The
sketch shows the support for doubles and strings. Note that is also has a
`doStringAndDouble(.,.)` method. This is because the child nodes have of course
different semantics so that we need to specify the desired behavior for all
combinations as well.

```java
abstract class PlusNode extends BinaryNode {

  @Specialization
  public String doStrings(String left, String right) {
    return left + right;
  }

  @Specialization
  public double doDoubles(double left, double right) {
    return left + right;
  }

  @Specialization
  public String doStringAndDouble(String left, double right) {
    return left + right;
  }
  // ... and a few other combinations, incl. int and long
}
```

The bit operations are only defined for integers and longs, so the resulting
`BitXorNode` looks like this:

```java
abstract class BitXorNode extends BinaryNode {
  @Specialization
  public long doLongs(long left, long right) {
    return left ^ right;
  }

  @Specialization
  public int doIntegers(int left, int right) {
    return left ^ right;
  }
}
```

## Unary Operations: Type Coercions and the `not` Operator

The next item of out list are unary operators for value casting. Specifically,
we need to implement `intValue(.)` and `doubleValue(.)`. You might remember
from the last post that we handled the `println(.)` method specially. It is a
method defined on the Golo's `Predefined` class that takes only one parameter,
too. Our solution the last time was to create a `PrintlnNode` during the lookup
and directly replace the `UninitializedInvocationNode` AST node with this node.
During execution, this has the major advantage that there is no overhead for
function calls or even argument wrapping. To properly support Mandelbrot in
Golo, we need explicit coercions for integer and double values. Of course,
these are simple operations that should not have any overhead. Thus, we use the
same approach.

The nodes are defined as follows:

```java
@NodeChild(value = "expr", type = ExpressionNode.class)
abstract class UnaryNode extends ExpressionNode { }

abstract class IntValue extends UnaryNode implements PreEvaluated {

  abstract Object executeEvaluated(VirtualFrame frame, Object value);

  @Override
  public Object doEvaluated(VirtualFrame frame, Object[] args) {
    return executeEvaluated(frame, args[0]);
  }

  @Specialization
  public int doDouble(double value) {
    return (int) value;
  }
}
```

On the first look, this seems to be more complicated than necessary. The reason
that we implement the `PreEvaluated` interface is because of the way node
specialization should work. Normally, a `specialize(.)` method will replace the
old node in the tree and return the new one so that it can be used directly to
execute (see [previous post][TODO]). However, it needs to take the already
pre-evaluated arguments. For that purpose, we implement the interface and the
corresponding `doEvaluated(.)` method. The abstract `executeEvaluated(.)` will
actually be implemented by the TruffleDSL and we do not have to do that
manually. The main functionality of the node is realized with the
specialization `doDouble(.)`, which merely casts the double value to an integer
value. For the `doubleValue(.)` operation, the implementation is essentially
the same.

The `not` operator is handled differently in Golo. Instead of being a function
invocation, it is a keyword. We will skip over how to add the necessary support
to the Golo IR to Truffle visitor. In the end, the executing AST node is
simply this:

```java
abstract class NotNode extends UnaryNode {
  @Specialization
  public boolean doBoolean(boolean value) {
    return !value;
  }
}
```

## Local Variables

One issue we have kept putting off so far is to support the notion of local
variables. For our Fibonacci function, we merely needed support for accessing
arguments (see [pref post, sec. X][TODO]). This was realized by accessing the
array that is passed on function invocation and is stored in the frame object
given to the `execute*(.)` methods. Now, we will use these frames to also store
local variables.

As a little bit of background, frames are the activation records of functions.
Thus, they keep the temporary state that is needed during the execution of a
function. This includes access to the actual arguments, local variables, and
possibly other execution state.

Truffle distinguishes two types of frames, virtual and materialized frames. The
first type is called *virtual* to indicate that the optimizer will not actually
create an object for the frame at runtime, instead, it will use the frame to
figure out the actual data dependencies between operations within a compilation
unit, i.e., a function and possibly additionally inlined functions. To make
this reliable the usage of virtual frames is restricted. For instance, they are
not supposed to be assigned to fields of other objects and cannot be passed to
methods of objects where Graal cannot determine the concrete method at
compilation time. Generally, virtual frames cannot *escape* the compilation
united, because this would mean that they need to be represented as a proper
object. Materialized frames on the other hand can be used like normal objects.
They do not underly the same restrictions, but come with a higher runtime cost.
Materialized frames are useful to implement features like closures.

In addition to giving the compiler the means to determine data dependencies,
frames are also meant to help it with determining the concrete type information.
For both reasons, frames come with a `FrameDescriptor`. On the one hand, it
maintains the structural information about the `slots` of a frame, and on the
other hand, the frame slots can record type information. For now, we will focus
on the structural elements, and will ignore the type information.

What does this mean concretely for our Truffle backend? For our `Function`
objects it means, we need to give them proper `FrameDescriptor`s so that the
structure of the frame is known. We do that in our `visitFunction(.)` method:

```java
public Function visitFunction(GoloFunction function) {
  FrameDescriptor frameDesc = new FrameDescriptor();
  context.frameDescriptors.push(frameDesc);

  ExpressionNode body = function.getBlock().accept(this);

  context.frameDescriptors.pop();
  return new Function(body, function, frameDesc);
}
```

While it is not really necessary for our purposes, we have a stack of
`frameDescriptors` in the visitor, because Golo supports nested functions.
And with this stack, we can model the lexical scoping of them correctly.

A bit more interesting is our change in the access for variables:

```java
public ExpressionNode visitReferenceLookup(ReferenceLookup referenceLookup) {
  LocalReference reference = referenceLookup.
          resolveIn(context.referenceTableStack.peek());
  if (reference.isArgument()) {
    return new LocalArgumentReadNode(reference.getIndex());
  } else {
    FrameSlot slot = getFrameSlot(reference);
    return LocalVariableReadNodeGen.create(slot);
  }
}

FrameSlot getFrameSlot(LocalReference reference) {
  return context.frameDescriptors.peek().
          findOrAddFrameSlot(reference.getName());
}
```

When we see that a reference is not an argument, they we create a
`LocalVariableReadNode`. This read node gets a `FrameSlot` object that is
created by the frame descriptor based on the name of the variable. Since we do
not care about type information, for the moment, a frame slot is thus merely
Truffle's handle to represent the variable.

Assignment statements are transformed similarly:

```java
public ExpressionNode visitAssignmentStatement(
    AssignmentStatement assignment) {
  LocalReference reference = assignment.getLocalReference();
  FrameSlot slot = getFrameSlot(reference);
  return LocalVariableWriteNodeGen.create(
      slot, (ExpressionNode) assignment.
                          getExpressionStatement().accept(this));
}
```

For them, we create a `LocalVariableWriteNode`. But of course, a write node
still needs the expression that computes the value it needs to write. So,
beside the slot, it also gets the transformed subexpression of the assignment
statement.

For the implementation of the read node, we got the following code:

```java
abstract class LocalVariableReadNode extends ExpressionNode {

  protected final FrameSlot slot;

  public LocalVariableReadNode(FrameSlot slot) {
    this.slot = slot;
  }

  @Specialization
  public Object doObject(VirtualFrame frame) {
    return frame.getValue(slot);
  }
}
```

The node is structured as usual. It takes the slot object as argument and stores
it in a final field so that the compiler knows it can rely on it as a constant.
The specialization does merely take the slot object to read a value from the
frame. There could be more specialization to read different primitive types from
the frame, but for the moment this is not necessary.

The write node looks more or less the same:

```java
@NodeChild(value = "expr", type = ExpressionNode.class)
abstract class LocalVariableWriteNode extends ExpressionNode {

  protected final FrameSlot slot;

  public LocalVariableWriteNode(FrameSlot slot) {
    this.slot = slot;
  }
  
  @Specialization
  public Object writeGeneric(VirtualFrame frame, Object exprValue) {
    ensureObjectKind();
    frame.setObject(slot, exprValue);
    return exprValue;
  }

  protected void ensureObjectKind() {
    if (slot.getKind() != FrameSlotKind.Object) {
      CompilerDirectives.transferToInterpreterAndInvalidate();
      slot.setKind(FrameSlotKind.Object);
    }
  }
}
```

Here we need to have the expression for the value that is to be written.
So, it is declared with an annotation. In the specialization, we get it as the
`expValue` argument. Note, when executing `writeGeneric(.)`, we first ensure
that the slot kind has been set to `Object`. The optimizer is able to remove
this, because it only reaches frame slots that have been initialized. Finally,
we set the `expValue` on the frame.

And that's all. With these nodes we support read and write operations for
local variables.

## Loops

The final element we need for the Mandelbrot function is iteration, or *loops*.
Golo got multiple types of loops including `for` and `while` loops.
Fortunately for us, Golo's IR already takes care of desugaring these constructs
to a single loop construct with explicit initialization, condition, body, and
post-condition.

### The Main Loop Node

 We translate this construct to the following node implementation:

```java
class ForLoopNode extends ExpressionNode {

  @Child protected ExpressionNode init;
  @Child protected LoopNode loopNode;

  public ForLoopNode(ExpressionNode init,
      ExpressionNode condition,
      ExpressionNode body,
      ExpressionNode post) {
    this.init = init;
    loopNode = Truffle.getRuntime().createLoopNode(
        new RepeatNode(condition, body, post));
  }

  @Override
  public Object executeGeneric(VirtualFrame frame) {
    if (init != null) {
      init.executeGeneric(frame);
    }
    try {
      loopNode.executeLoop(frame);
    } catch (BreakLoopException e) { /* just left the loop */ }
    return null;
  }
}
```

Our `ForLoopNode` got two `@Child` nodes. The first one is the `init`
expression. In a `for` loop like in Java or C, it typically initializes an
induction variable, e.g., `i`, with an initial value. The second child node is
Truffle's `LoopNode`, which realizes the iteration with support for
on-stack-replacement. More on that in a bit.

The `executeGeneric(.)` first executes the `init` expression if available, and
afterwards the loop. In case the loop contained a `break` keyword, we would
throw a control-flow exception that is caught here.

### Using Truffle's `LoopNode`

The actual iteration happens in the `LoopNode`. For that, it requires an
implementation of the `RepeatingNode` interface. The interface has a single
method which does a loop iteration and indicates whether it should continue. As
mentioned before, this abstraction is ment to enable on-stack-replacement. This
is a useful feature for longrunning methods that contain loops. Normally, the
execution would only reach a newly compiled native code version of a method
when it is entered again. With on-stack-replacement however, the VM can detect
methods with long running loops and switch to the optimized native code even
while executing the loop.

Our implementation of the `RepeatingNode` interface looks as follows:

```java
class RepeatNode extends Node implements RepeatingNode {

  @Child protected ExpressionNode condition;
  @Child protected ExpressionNode body;
  @Child protected ExpressionNode post;

  public RepeatNode(ExpressionNode condition,
      ExpressionNode body, ExpressionNode post) {
    this.condition = condition;
    this.body = body;
    this.post = post;
  }

  @Override
  public boolean executeRepeating(VirtualFrame frame) {
    if (shouldExecute(frame)) {
      body.executeGeneric(frame);
      if (post != null) {
        post.executeGeneric(frame);
      }
      return true;
    } else {
      return false;
    }
  }

  private boolean shouldExecute(VirtualFrame frame) {
    try {
      return condition.executeBoolean(frame);
    } catch (UnexpectedResultException e) {
      CompilerDirectives.transferToInterpreter();
      throw new UnsupportedSpecializationException(
          this, new Node[]{condition}, e.getResult());
    }
  }
}
```

It got child nodes for the loop condition, the loop body, and a `post`
expression that is evaluated after each iteration. The method `shouldExecute`
evaluates the loop condition. But since Golo is a dynamically typed language,
we can't be completely sure that the condition expression really returns a
boolean. Here we handle this case simply be throwing an exception that
indicates that this case is not yet supported.

The `executeRepeating(.)` method represents one iteration. Thus, it first
checks whether the loop should continue executing by invoking
`shouldExecute(.)`, and if that is the case, it executes the loop's `body`.
After executing the body, it also executes the `post` expression if it is
present. The return value of `executeRepeating(.)` indicates whether the
iteration should be continued. Beside the minor complications, implementing a
loop construct is thus pretty simple. If on-stack-replacement is not desired
for some reason, one could implement the loop also directly using any Java loop
construct.

### The `break` Keyword in Loops

As we have seen earlier, Golo also supports the `break` keyword to exit from
loops. The implementation idea is very similar to handling the `return`
keyword. The AST node for the `break` keyword is going to throw a control-flow
exception. And as we have seen in the `ForLoopNode`, we handle it with a `try
{...} catch (BreakLoopException e)` around the execution of the loop body.
Thus, the `break` keyword is implemented with the following `BreakLoopNode`:

```java
class BreakLoopNode extends ExpressionNode {

  @Override
  public Object executeGeneric(VirtualFrame frame) {
    throw new BreakLoopException();
  }
}
```

The node will simply raise the `BreakLoopException` which returns execution to
the `ForLoopNode`. After catching the exception, execution simply continues
after the loop.

## Invoking Arbitrary Java Methods

Golo is designed to be a dynamic language for the JVM ecosystem. Thus, it
embraces Java and its ecosystem and Golo programs use Java libraries
throughout. So far, we added dedicated nodes for each functionality. Applying
the same approach here would not be scalable. So, we need a way to call Java
methods in a more *reflective* fashion.

Since Golo's lookup mechanism returns for some cases already Java
`MethodHandle`s, we added a `MethodHandleInvokeNode`:

```java
class MethodHandleInvokeNode extends FunctionInvocationNode {
  private final MethodHandle method;

  public MethodHandleInvokeNode(FunctionInvocationNode uninit,
      MethodHandle method) {
    super(uninit.name, uninit.module, uninit.argumentsNode);
    this.method = method;
  }

  @Override
  public Object executeEvaluated(VirtualFrame frame,
      Object[] args) {
    try {
      return method.invokeWithArguments(args);
    } catch (Throwable e) {
      throw new NotYetImplemented();
    }
  }
}
```

This node becomes part of the function invocation specialization. So, if we get
a `MethodHandle` as return, the `UninitializedFunctionInvocationNode` rewrites
itself to this `MethodHandleInvokeNode`. When it is executed, it simply calls
`invokeWithArguments(.)`.

For our benchmark, this is used to call the methods that read the System's time.

```

As result, we see that Mandelbrot takes about `r round(j)`ms to execute on
Java and about `r round(g)`ms on Golo, which means, Golo is about `r slowdown_g`x
slower for our Mandelbrot benchmark. This leaves hopefully plenty of room to
increase Golo's performance.

`r slowdown_t`x
