Type Hierarchies and Guards
===========================

This note is based on my observations in [SOMns][9] and changes to its [message
dispatch mechanism][2]. Specifically, I refactored the main message dispatch
chain in SOMns. As in Self and Newspeak, all interactions with objects are
message sends. Thus, field access and method invocation is essentially the
same. This means that message sending is a key to good performance.

In my previous design, I structured the dispatch chain in a way that, I
thought, I'd reduce the necessary runtime checks. This design decision still
came from [TruffleSOM][4] where the class hierarchy was much simpler and it
still seems to work.

My *naive* design distinguished two different cases. One case is that the
receiver is a standard Java objects, for instance boxed primitives such as
`longs` and `doubles`, or other Java objects that is used directly. The second
case is objects from my own hierarchy of Smalltalk objects under
[`SAbstractObject`][5].

The hierarchy is a little more involved, it includes the [abstract class][5], a
class for objects that have a Smalltalk class [`SObjectWithClass`][6], a [class
for objects without fields][7], for [objects with fields][8], and that one is
then again subclassed by classes for mutable and immutable objects. There are
still a few more details to it, but I think you get the idea.

So, with that, I thought, let's structure the dispatch chain like this,
starting with a message send node as its root:

```
MsgSend
 -> JavaRcvr
 -> JavaRcvr
 -> CheckIsSOMObject
     \-> UninitializedJavaRcvr
 -> SOMRcvr
 -> SOMRcvr
 -> UninitializedSOMRcvr
```

This represents a dispatch chain for a message send site that has seen four
different receivers, two primitive types, and two Smalltalk types. This
could be the case for instance for the polymorphic `+` message.

The main idea was to split the chain in two parts so that I avoid checking
for the SOM object more than once, and then can just cast the receiver to
`SObjectWithClass` in the second part of the chain to be able to read the
Smalltalk class from it.

Now it turns out, *this is not the best idea*. The main problem is that
`SObjectWithClass` is not a leaf class in my SOMns hierarchy (this is the case
in TruffleSOM though, where it originates). This means, at runtime, the check,
i.e., the guard for `SObjectWithClass` can be expensive. When I looked at the
compilation in IGV, I saw many `instanceof` checks that could not be removed
and resulted in runtime traversal of the class hierarchy, to confirm that a
specific concrete class was indeed a subclass of `SObjectWithClass`.

In order to avoid these expensive checks, I refactored the dispatch nodes to
extract the [guard into its own node][1] that does only the minimal amount
of work for each specific case. And it only ever checks for the specific
leaf class of my hierarchy that is expected for a specific receiver.

This also means, the new dispatch chain is not separated in parts anymore as
it was before. Instead, the nodes are simply added in the order in which
the different receiver types are observed over time.

Overall the [performance impact is rather large][3]. I saw on the Richards
benchmark a gain of 10% and on DeltaBlue about 20%. Unfortunately [my
refactoring][2] also changed a few other details beside the changes related
to `instanceof` and casts. It also made the guards for objects with fields
depend on the object layout instead of the class, which avoids having
multiple guards for essentially the same constraint further down the road.

So, the main take-away here is that the choice of guard types can have a
major performance impact. I also had a couple of other `@Specialization`
nodes that were using non-leaf classes. For instance like this:
`@Specialization public Object doSOMObject(SObjectWithClass rcvr) {...}`

This looks inconspicuous at first, but fixing those and a few other things
resulted in overall runtime reduction on multiple benchmarks between 20%
and 30%.

A good way to find these issues is to see in IGV that `instanceof` or
checked cast snippets are inlined and not completely removed. Often they
are already visible in the list of phases when the snippets are resolved.
Another way to identify them is the use of the Graal option
`-Dgraal.option.TraceTrufflePerformanceWarnings=true` (I guess that would
be `-G:+TraceTrufflePerformanceWarnings` when mx is used). The output names
the specific non-leaf node checks that have been found in the graph. Not
all of them are critical, because they can be removed by later phases. To
check that, you can use the id of the node from the output and search for
it in the corresponding IGV graph using for instance `id=3235` in the
search field.
